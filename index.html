<p>
Yo! My name is Oluwanifemi Maiorano (oh-lou-wah-knee-fuh-mi), I'm a Computer Science Major at the University of South Carolina and in my first year of college. 
Since I was young, I've always had a love for softwares and an adoration for how they operate behind the scenes to create what it is that we interact with and use on a day-to-day basis, 
hence my decision on majoring in Computer Science. What founded this love for softwares is my introduction to videogames at a very young age. I've always (and will continue to)
loved videogames and the intricacies behind specific mechanics and operations, which is why my overall dream goal would be to one day participate in developing a successful and fun 
game for all to enjoy and play.
